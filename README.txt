Snackwich is an adaptation of the Snack console UI framework. Snack is, itself,
a port of Newt to Python. Newt is the console UI framework used in Redhat 
console applications. As there is no readily available console menu system 
available for Curses, this is the best option out there, and it works like a
dream.

The only requirement is that the Snack framework is installed. Under Ubuntu,
this is the "python-newt" package. It includes "snack.py", along with a 
dynamic library.
